  `As the director of a zoo, experiencing the animals in real life is an amazing experience. For many years the person who was in charge of this position experienced and studied these animals from countries all around the world.<br /> When the time came for retirement, he passed on his knowledge and experience to his grandson. <br />
One day grandfather walked into the office of his grandson and knew, just knew that nothing else would satisfy him like watching these creatures in their natural habitats. No more feedings and tests, just watching them roam free for as long as he could before it was time to say goodbye again.`,
  `Kyle was sitting in front of the computer looking at a price on the exotic animals website Jungle Jim’s Animal Experience. The first animal was a Komodo dragon. It cost over two million dollars. Kyle then clicks on different animals and it tell what is needed to buy them and how long they will live with their new owner.
  The profile takes you to a page that shows all the kind of exotic animals they have.  
  In the middle of the screen there’s links for cattery, facility & friends. Kyle clicked on facility where all cages looked fine from. In the top left hand corner there is a chat box from Jimmy (customer service). This chat box can be used for anything that needs more information about the company, but Jimmy says ask about a pet before stepping into chat box.`,
  `One day, our protagonist Kyouhei Shigeto receives an offer to develop a new full-immersion Virtual Reality game that immerses the participants completely into a forest forest. The gameplay was to use an avatar modeled after the user and they would become immersed in an eco-thermal sanctuary to experience nature up close. But the odd thing is Kyouhei kept having these questions -- how could they allow people to pick one of many possible different animals and how could they even on earth mix up animals?
  <br />
  The most logical answer Kyouhei poses is if it was not on Earth, then it would make sense as Earth only has 7 continents and different types of animals conserved in their own habitats. So if it was a game where somebody was able to pick whichever virtual animal he wanted, it would be a great place for someone like Kyouhei who doesn't have much free time to go just explore this immersive world by himself.`,
  `Pokémon are only available in Animal Jam, but not in real life. The footprints only show drawings of animals like camels, llamas, fish and lizards.

  `Jen is a zoologist that works in a zoo. She has her suspicions whether animals are getting the correct injections in order to ensure them better breeding rates. One day, there was a hairless, wrinkly gray ape with vegetables sticking through the cage. Jen noticed that this monkey was nearly retired. Sean (panda), Claudio (deer) and Bernie (bat) were the other healthy active animals on exhibit that day.<br /> It was then that Jen realizes these poor monkeys were injected with penicillin which is only effective against bacterial infection--not skin afflictions like a cold or herpes virus like she witnessed today!

  `The fiery skeletal circus continues to prepare for their act to come clanging hammers and tinkling piano keys, hammering mirrors and climbing ropes, smashing balls yet careful not to fall off <br />
  Jen digs up her credentials and goes undercover as another medic, who could replace one of the monkeys with a different type of vaccine--guaranteeing the zoo would get better breeding rates and have healthier primates to capture on film for the children to see before they stepped out of the exhibit exit gates for their next adventure. You see Jen's distress on`,
  `The man, an observant ethical vegetarian, arrives at a zoo before it closes to find much of the attraction empty as the animals are all tucked away in preparation for early morning. The man spies a small sign indicating that something more exciting is happening in the Tropical Wetland with four flamingos. The flamingos take a keen interest and swamp the man nearly throwing him into the fish pond for a long fall, but luckily he can safety grab on to one of their beaks which is only slightly less gripping that steel. The large birds then propel him high up to see what's going on. Up in the sky which once boasted a shining sun, now consumed with its radiation below appear five grinning skull-faces of happy aliens framed by beams of light hurdling about amidst shooting flames and sparks.

  `A man falls into a deep funk after his wife divorces him, forcing him with the impression of living in a zoo.
  <br /> In the story <br /> Peter the philosopher always think of the zoo as just a place where animals stay, they don’t think it’s something relevant to him. But this visit changed everything and think of it over and over letting his spirit break. He argued with anyone who tried to cheer his mood up.<br /> 

  He would get worse day after day and until he made a find: <br /> Peter felt too tired and hopelessly numb to stand up for izzie-the-goldfish when his kids refused to do what their father had ordered them to. All he wanted was for people realize that the animal weren’t just some household appliance but sentient beings who even get sad when the world feels absent from their heart beat. But the more he cared, the more he felt like something was happening on top of himself-bel `,
  `Zoo—A story of what it means to be human<br />
 
  <br />Siblings Sophia and her brother Murray are watching movies in their living room. The movies stir deep memories of their childhood when they wondered if a blue-eyed, brown skinned, white cat calling "Cloey" could be endangered and when knowledge, even though gained from the internet, was all they had. <br /> She recalled that she had argued with her parents over the tiger, Bengal Tiger or Malayan Tiger until she knew enough to win, but as she learned more facts about tigers and talked to a biologist about conservation status for endangered animals in Cameroon, this tiger might have been first housed in a zoo. Momentarily relieved that the Tigers were safe and undecided on which is the more appropriate name for this acclimatized cat then she started to question how many zoos were there?`,
  `After the an unusual snow falls on all the cities, animals, who coexist with humans in society, starts to form packs, and attack buildings. Managing not only to break into homes but also into hospitals and genetic research labs, stealing blood and experimental specimens, attacking any humans they came across -especially people close to academia- who they seemed to severely despise due to them working with animals. <br /> <br /> One vicious animal has killed many two legged creatures already.
  <br /> <br />
  It all has one of the cities in a state of panic because the culture was to respect animals. Laws were made but no one could find a solution on how to stop all this until the advisor's little brother finds it's coming from the zoo. Opening it up after 11pm (closing time), he sees that there are a few observers left and they're asleep in front of their TV rather than watching over the animals. The advisor then goes to them only for them to just shoo him away because he's human

  `The Zoo is a family-owned establishment that has been in operation for 300 years. However, it has fallen on hard times lately.

  Tina is the soon to be 18-yea- old daughter of the founder and current owners of the zoo. The purchase of her Dad's new orange camaro would be a saving grace for both her heart, but more importantly, the Zoo.

  Tina spends most of her time caring for baby animals, reading favorite books, and just daydreaming about being away from the Zoo.`,
